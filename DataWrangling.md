Exploring the data \###‘select()’ allows to select specific columns

``` r
microbiome.fungi2 <- select(microbiome.fungi, SampleID, Crop, Compartment:Fungicide, richness) #Compartment:Fungicide used because all those columns were in order and : can be used to select them all
```

\###‘filter()’. Function that allows to subset data easily

``` r
head(filter(microbiome.fungi2, Treatment == "Conv."))
```

\###We can use the summarise() function to find things like means and
standard deviations/errors

``` r
microbiome.fungi %>%
  select(SampleID, Crop, Compartment:Fungicide, richness) %>% # selecting columns
  filter(Treatment == "Conv.") %>% # subsetting to only include the conventional treatment
  mutate(logRich = log(richness)) %>% # creating a new column of the log richness
  summarise(Mean.rich = mean(logRich)) # calculating overall mean log richness within the conventionally managed treatment
```

    ##   Mean.rich
    ## 1  2.304395

\###Connecting multiple summary statistics here.

``` r
microbiome.fungi %>%
  select(SampleID, Crop, Compartment:Fungicide, richness) %>% # selecting columns
  filter(Treatment == "Conv.") %>% # subsetting to only include the conventional treatment
  mutate(logRich = log(richness)) %>% # creating a new column of the log richness
  summarise(Mean.rich = mean(logRich), # calculating the mean richness, stdeviation, and standard error
            n = n(), 
            sd.dev = sd(logRich)) %>%
  mutate(std.err = sd.dev/sqrt(n))
```

    ##   Mean.rich   n    sd.dev   std.err
    ## 1  2.304395 144 0.7024667 0.0585389

\###we want to have summary statistics by group! We can also do this
very easily using the group_by() function.

``` r
microbiome.fungi %>%
  select(SampleID, Crop, Compartment:Fungicide, richness) %>% # selecting columns
  group_by(Treatment, Fungicide) %>% # grouping by treatment and fungicide to later calculate summary stats by group
  mutate(logRich = log(richness)) %>% # creating a new column of the log richness
  summarise(Mean.rich = mean(logRich), # calculating the mean richness, stdeviation, and standard error
            n = n(), 
            sd.dev = sd(logRich)) %>%
  mutate(std.err = sd.dev/sqrt(n))
```

    ## `summarise()` has regrouped the output.

\###Connecting to ggplot directly. Just use the aesthetics in your pipe.

  summarise(Mean.rich = mean(logRich), # calculating the mean richness, stdeviation, and standard error
            n = n(), 
            sd.dev = sd(logRich)) %>%
  mutate(std.err = sd.dev/sqrt(n)) %>%
  ggplot(aes(x = Fungicide, y = Mean.rich)) + # adding in a ggplot

\###Joining the data. left_join() - Keep all rows of X and add matching
rows from Y. Any rows in Y that don’t match X are excluded.

- right_join() - reverse of left_join() -inner_join() - only keep rows

- full_join() - Keep any columns that are in either X or Y.

\###Pivoting \#Pivoting is also useful for converting from wide to long
format and back again. We can do this with pivot_longer() and
pivot_wider().

``` r
microbiome.fungi %>%
  select(SampleID, Crop, Compartment:Fungicide, richness) %>% # selecting columns  filter(Class == "Sordariomycetes") %>%
  group_by(Treatment, Fungicide) %>% # grouping by treatment and fungicide to later calculate summary stats by group
  summarise(Mean = mean(richness)) # calculates the mean per Treatment and Fungicide 
```

    ## `summarise()` has regrouped the output.
    ## ℹ Summaries were computed grouped by Treatment and Fungicide.
    ## ℹ Output is grouped by Treatment.
    ## ℹ Use `summarise(.groups = "drop_last")` to silence this message.
    ## ℹ Use `summarise(.by = c(Treatment, Fungicide))` for per-operation grouping
    ##   (`?dplyr::dplyr_by`) instead.

    ## # A tibble: 4 × 3
    ## # Groups:   Treatment [2]
    ##   Treatment Fungicide  Mean
    ##   <chr>     <chr>     <dbl>
    ## 1 Conv.     C         14.6 
    ## 2 Conv.     F          9.75
    ## 3 No-till   C         15.4 
    ## 4 No-till   F         13.1

\#Wide format- sets the values within fungicide column into column
names.

``` r
microbiome.fungi %>%
  select(SampleID, Crop, Compartment:Fungicide, richness) %>% # selecting columns  filter(Class == "Sordariomycetes") %>%
  group_by(Treatment, Fungicide) %>% # grouping by treatment and fungicide to later calculate summary stats by group
  summarise(Mean = mean(richness)) %>% # calculates the mean per Treatment and Fungicide 
  pivot_wider(names_from = Fungicide, values_from = Mean) # pivot to wide format
```

    ## `summarise()` has regrouped the output.
    ## ℹ Summaries were computed grouped by Treatment and Fungicide.
    ## ℹ Output is grouped by Treatment.
    ## ℹ Use `summarise(.groups = "drop_last")` to silence this message.
    ## ℹ Use `summarise(.by = c(Treatment, Fungicide))` for per-operation grouping
    ##   (`?dplyr::dplyr_by`) instead.

    ## # A tibble: 2 × 3
    ## # Groups:   Treatment [2]
    ##   Treatment     C     F
    ##   <chr>     <dbl> <dbl>
    ## 1 Conv.      14.6  9.75
    ## 2 No-till    15.4 13.1

Easier to take the differences between control and treatment group.

``` r
microbiome.fungi %>%
  select(SampleID, Crop, Compartment:Fungicide, richness) %>% # selecting columns  filter(Class == "Sordariomycetes") %>%
  group_by(Treatment, Fungicide) %>% # grouping by treatment and fungicide to later calculate summary stats by group
  summarise(Mean = mean(richness)) %>% # calculates the mean per Treatment and Fungicide 
  pivot_wider(names_from = Fungicide, values_from = Mean) %>% # pivot to wide format
  mutate(diff.fungicide = C - F) # calculate the difference between the means. 
```

    ## `summarise()` has regrouped the output.
    ## ℹ Summaries were computed grouped by Treatment and Fungicide.
    ## ℹ Output is grouped by Treatment.
    ## ℹ Use `summarise(.groups = "drop_last")` to silence this message.
    ## ℹ Use `summarise(.by = c(Treatment, Fungicide))` for per-operation grouping
    ##   (`?dplyr::dplyr_by`) instead.

    ## # A tibble: 2 × 4
    ## # Groups:   Treatment [2]
    ##   Treatment     C     F diff.fungicide
    ##   <chr>     <dbl> <dbl>          <dbl>
    ## 1 Conv.      14.6  9.75           4.89
    ## 2 No-till    15.4 13.1            2.32

``` r
microbiome.fungi %>%
  select(SampleID, Crop, Compartment:Fungicide, richness) %>% # selecting columns  
  group_by(Treatment, Fungicide) %>% # grouping by treatment and fungicide to later calculate summary stats by group
  summarise(Mean = mean(richness)) %>% # calculates the mean per Treatment and Fungicide 
  pivot_wider(names_from = Fungicide, values_from = Mean) %>% # pivot to wide format
  mutate(diff.fungicide = C - F) %>%  # calculate the difference between the means. 
  ggplot(aes(x = Treatment, y = diff.fungicide)) + # Plot it 
  geom_col() +
  theme_minimal() +
  xlab("") +
  ylab("Difference in average species richness")
```
